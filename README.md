API Vs SOA

APIs are generally associated with REST/JSON and SOA is associated with XML and SOAP, SOA is more than just a protocol. SOA is an architectural best practice around building de-coupled applications and fosters service re-use. 
The API Economy is also all about creating services and making them available in an open fashion.
APIs can be used for both external and internal use-cases. The key difference between APIs and SOA being that APIs are more open, well documented and can be often self-provisioned, with little or no guidance, making them better suited for mass developer/partner consumption. SOA or XML services are pre-dominantly used for internal use-cases, though they are prevalent in a number of external B2B scenarios.


While APIs are currently associated with REST and JSON, there are other protocols like web-sockets, MQTT etc. that are gaining prominence for specific use-cases. Just as SOAP has it merits and limitations, REST will be replaced by something else. API providers should look at deploying API Management platforms that future proof (and past-proof with SOA support) their deployment with an unified infrastructure, rather than taking a tiered approach. You do not want to deploy another tiered infrastructure once another protocol surfaces
